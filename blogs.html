          <p><span>Jul 26, 2013 - </span>117 days ago, Boolean-based SQL injection is a technique which relies on sending an SQL query to the database. This injection technique forces the application to return a different result, depending on the query. Depending on the boolean result (TRUE or FALSE), the content within the HTTP response will change, or remain the same. The result allows an attacker to judge whether the payload used returns true or false, even though no data from the database are recovered. Also, it is a slow attack; this will help the attacker to enumerate the database. Reference:- https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/vulnerability/boolean-based-blind-sql-injection.html

          <p><span>About 2.690.000 results (0,31 seconds).</span> SQL injection vulnerabilities arise when user-controllable data is incorporated into database SQL queries in an unsafe manner. An attacker can supply crafted input to break out of the data context in which their input appears and interfere with the structure of the surrounding query.
          A wide range of damaging attacks can often be delivered via SQL injection, including reading or modifying critical application data, interfering with application logic, escalating privileges within the database and taking control of the database server.

          <p>According to Alibaba founder Jack Ma, “Blockchain technology could change our world more than people imagine.”
          Michael Casey from MIT Digital Currency Initiative explains blockchain as a new method of record-keeping.
          It is a decentralized system of many computers around the globe, that work in concert to produce a distributed ledger to keep a record of the blockchain marketplace transactions.
          Transactions are verified through consensus — participants confirm changes with one another — and cryptography ensures the security of the information.
          Blockchain helps to avoid the risks of relying on a single entity: potential breakdowns and hacking attacks.
          Decentralization is a key to the technology and facilitates peer-to-peer exchange on the blockchain online platforms, which are also called decentralized marketplaces. …</p>

          The Bitcoin blockchain is a public record of all Bitcoin transactions. You might also hear the term used as a “public ledger.” The blockchain shows every single record of bitcoin transactions in order, dating back to the very first one. The entire blockchain can be downloaded and openly reviewed by anyone, or you can use a block explorer to review the blockchain online.</p>

          <p><span>Jul 24, 2013 - </span>What is Encoding?
          The purpose of encoding is to transform data so that it can be properly (and safely) consumed by a different type of system, e.g. binary data being sent over email, or viewing special characters on a web page. The goal is not to keep information secret, but rather to ensure that it’s able to be properly consumed.
          Encoding transforms data into another format using a scheme that is publicly available so that it can easily be reversed. It does not require a key as the only thing required to decode it is the algorithm that was used to encode it.
          What is Decoding?
          The reverse format of encoding is called decoding which is only be decrypted by that person who knows algorithm by which message is encoded. …</p>

          One of the most innovative and impactful renovation to be made in recent times is undoubtedly the blockchain technology. Decentralized transactions enabled by blockchain have the potential to disrupt several industries across all sectors. Furthermore, transactions carried out through a blockchain are much more secure, transparent, private and done at low fees.
          Apart from helping the banking sector make faster transactions at lower costs, improved security, and better record keeping, blockchain technology can also improve electronic voting machines. Integrating this technology into a voting system could prevent governments from tampering with votes because blockchain creates publicly viewable and singed transaction that can’t be changed or rewritten. Experts believe that the blockchain technology has the capability to change the world over the next 20 years. …</p>
